So there is a task at hand:
- A team is exploring the possibility of building a solution that will help in migration of customers using resco mobile app to D365 field service mobile app.
- For understanding a comparison needs to be created on resco mobile app vs d365 field service mobile app.
- Potential use cases in future and Target audience
- A SRS level detail documentation that encompasses the solution understanding, key benefits, details of when is the best scenario to use, pro and cons of the same.

Now tell me what you understand and what exactly should we gather ( a list of info) to understand both the systems first, then make up about creating a solution that will help to migrate from resco system to MS dynamics field service.

Step 1: Comparative Analysis
Create the comprehensive comparison document covering the points above clearly, structured in a side-by-side comparison table format.

Step 2: Identify Target Audiences & Use Cases
Clearly define your target audience based on industry and role.

Document potential use cases of both Resco and D365 FS clearly indicating future scenarios, scalability, and roadmap alignment.

Step 3: Develop SRS-level Documentation
Structure your document into clear sections:

Introduction & Overview

Functional & Technical Specifications

Detailed Comparison (Pros, Cons, Best use-case scenarios)

Migration Considerations (Detailed technical migration path, tooling, APIs, data mapping, etc.)

Benefits & ROI

Risks & Mitigations

Step 4: Design Migration Solution
Develop a detailed migration solution including:

Data extraction and mapping steps.

Integration methods.

Handling of customizations.

Data validation and quality assurance steps.

Recommended migration strategy (phased or big-bang).

Post-migration support considerations.

Your goal is to have:

A clear understanding document of both apps.

An extensive comparative analysis.

A structured, detailed SRS-like documentation.

A practical, implementable migration solution that helps customers smoothly transition from Resco to Dynamics 365 Field Service.
